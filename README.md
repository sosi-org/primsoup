* `actn`
Simple Action Minimizer

Based on the concept of "Action" defined on "trajectories".
Action and Lagragian are concepts defined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange that are able to describe the whole classical mechanics.

This script finds a tajectory that minimises the Lagrange-ian Action.
It uses random local search (some local Monte Carlo) in space of trajectories.
